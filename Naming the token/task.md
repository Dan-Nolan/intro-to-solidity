## Give the token a name
When you hear about cryptocurrencies in the news, they always have a name. As of right now, your token doesn't have a name (or a symbol for that matter). Let's fix that!

- Create 3 public constant values in the Token contract
    - `string name` should be set to `Token`
    - `string symbol` should be set to `TOK`
    - `uint8 decimals` should be set to `18`
