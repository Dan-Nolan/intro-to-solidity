## Congratulations!

Hurray! Your token is now fully ERC20 compliant! Don't deploy the smart contract to a blockchain yet though; the token is still not safe to use. 

In the next stage, you'll make your token (more) secure and also learn about some of the ways that hackers could break the token you currently have.
