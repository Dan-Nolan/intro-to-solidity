## Nice job!

You now have a token that resembles many of the ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. Your token is ERC20 compliant, and it is now safe against underflow attacks. 

In the next stage, you'll create a **SafeMath** library, and change your token to use that instead. I think you'll like what you see!
