## Congratulations!

Nice job! You just wrote your first Solidity contract. In fact, this contract was deployed to a test blockchain when you pressed **run test**, so you can now say that you have used a blockchain (if you hadn't already)!

In all of the following lessons, you will use what you learned in this lesson to write smart contracts. For the next few stages, the contract structure and the pragma statement will be provided. After that, you will be expected to write these yourself. This will help your brain to remember how to write smart contracts in the future. 

In the next stage, we'll dive into **functions**!
