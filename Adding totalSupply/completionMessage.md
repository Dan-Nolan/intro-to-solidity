## Awesome!

So far so good! You've now made a cryptocurrency that has a total supply of tokens! People can now look at your token, and they can see how many of your tokens there are. 

In the next stage, we're going to take your token a step further by giving individual Ethereum addresses **balances**. Right now, the idea of tokens exists in the token contract, but nobody actually owns them. That is about to change!
