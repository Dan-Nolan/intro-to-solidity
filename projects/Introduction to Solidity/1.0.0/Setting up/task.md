# Setting up the environment

## Getting Started
Welcome to the Introduction to Solidity Lesson! In this lesson, you will gain a foundational education of the Solidity programming language by building your own ERC20 token.

Solidity experience is not required for this tutorial and, the tutorial can be completed with a minimal amount of programming experience. Throughout the lesson, you will learn some general programming concepts that will carry over into other languages.

## Tasks
Throughout the lessons, you will be provided tasks to complete for each "stage". To pass the stage, you will complete the specified tasks, which will cause the test cases to pass. 

In this stage, the task is to complete the following:
- Complete the **pragma solidity** statement by specifying that we are using compiler version 0.5.0
- Create an empty Solidity contract called **Token**
