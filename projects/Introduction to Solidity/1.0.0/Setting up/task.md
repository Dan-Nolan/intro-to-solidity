# Setting up the environment

In this lesson, you will create a smart contract called a **Token** smart contract. You can think of tokens like *dollars* (or any other type of asset). Tokens can be given to other people, they can be lent to other people via allowances, and you can see how many tokens someone owns.

This section will introduce a lot of material to get you started so that later sections can focus more on the core concepts surrounding ERC20 tokens.

## Tasks
In each stage of this lesson you will be given tasks to complete on the *tasks* page. These tasks are the high level goals for the stage, and you will have to complete them to move onto the next stage. 

In this stage, your task consists of completing the following bullet points:
- Complete the **pragma solidity** statement by specifying that we are using compiler version 0.5.0
- Create an empty Solidity contract called **Token**

## Details
Each stage has a *details* page that provides in-depth coverage of the concepts that are being taught. Most of the resources that are provided in this lesson will be found in the *details* section, so it is recommended to read both the *tasks* and *details* pages for each stage.
