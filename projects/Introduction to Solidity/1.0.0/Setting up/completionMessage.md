## Congratulations!

Nice job! You just wrote your first Solidity contract. In fact, this contract was deployed to a test blockchain when you pressed **run test**, so you can now say that you have used a blockchain (if you hadn't already)!

In all of the following lessons, you will use what you learned in this lesson to write smart contracts. 

In the next stage, we'll dive into **variables**!
