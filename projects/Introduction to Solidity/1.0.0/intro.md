## Introduction

Welcome to the Introduction to Solidity Lesson! This lesson consists of several stages that teach several foundational features of the Solidity programming language. These features include:

1. Contracts
2. Functions
3. Modifiers
4. Global Variables
5. Events

## Project

Chainshot's lessons encapsulate a form of learning known as [project based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project-based_learning). This style of learning is focused on learning through working on "real-world" projects. In this lesson, you will build an ERC20 smart contract, which may actually be better than many live ERC20 contracts that are in existence (**do not take this as a license to deploy your contract; there are almost certainly security vulnerabilities in the ERC20 that is created here, and it should not be considered "deployment ready"**).

During each stage of this lesson, parts of an **ERC20** token smart contract are built. By the end of this lesson, you will have produced a functioning **ERC20** token. As it happens, there are many **ERC20** tokens that exist, and building your own token will help with understanding other token smart contracts. Once you understand the basics of how an ERC20 token operates, your understanding of *contracts*, *functions*, *modifiers*, etc. will be good enough to start diving in to deeper projects.

## Security Topics

This lesson also discusses techniques that can be used to create smart contracts that are secured from some vulnerabilities. In particular, **Integer Underflow and Overflow** attacks in Solidity are discussed, and a mitigation is presented.

In this lesson you will also learn some of the most common attacks on smart contracts, but be aware that this is not comprehensive. The smart contract that we produce will be safe from several classes of vulnerabilites, but **it should still not be used in production**. Learning about all of the major vulnerability classes that can affect smart contracts is possible; however, it is worthy of one (or several) books rather than an introductory lesson. As such, **total security** (if it even exists) is out of the scope of this lesson. 

## Resources

Resources are provided along the way that will provide outlets to learn more about Solidity and Ethereum in general. These resources, along with most of the information in this lesson, will be found in the *details* section of each stage stage.

## Setting up

In the next stage, you will create the skeleton for your token smart contract that will provide the basis for all later stages. Have fun!
