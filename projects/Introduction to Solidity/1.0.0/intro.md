## Introduction

Welcome to the Introduction to Solidity Lesson! This lesson consists of several stages that teach several foundational features of the Solidity programming language. These features include:

1. Contracts
2. Functions
3. Modifiers
4. Global Variables
5. Events

This lesson also discusses techniques that can be used to create smart contracts that are secured from some vulnerabilities. In particular, **Integer Underflow and Overflow** attacks in Solidity are discussed, and a mitigation is presented.

During each stage of this lesson, parts of an **ERC20** token smart contract are built. By the end of this lesson, you will have produced a functioning **ERC20** token. As it happens, there are many **ERC20** tokens that exist, and building your own token will help with understanding other token smart contracts. 

Resources are provided along the way that will provide outlets to learn more about Solidity and Ethereum in general. These resources, along with most of the information in this lesson, will be found in the *details* section of each stage stage.

In the next stage, you will create the skeleton for your token smart contract. Have fun!
