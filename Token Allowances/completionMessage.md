# Nice one!

It may seem like you haven't done much yet, but looking back, you've actually implemented the ground work for the token. The token has a name, a symbol, and a number of decimals. Additionally, users now have balances and allowances. Finally, your token has a total supply of tokens. 

You'll get to start distributing these tokens in the next stage. In fact, every stage from now on will focus on adding features to the token. Get excited because it only gets better from here!
