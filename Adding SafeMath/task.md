## Using SafeMath
- Create a library called **SafeMath**
- Add the correct **using SafeMath for** statement to the **Token** contract.
- Refactor the **Token** contract to use **add** from **SafeMath** instead of **+** and **sub** from **SafeMath** instead of **-**

*Unlike the other tasks, this initial code for this stage is the same as the initial code for the previous stage.
